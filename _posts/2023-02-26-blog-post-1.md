In March 2021, Tariverdi et. al. published ['A Recurrent Neural-Network-Based Real-Time Dynamic Model for Soft Continuum Manipulators'](https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.631303) in 'Frontiers in Robotics and AI' focusing on dynamic modeling problem of soft continuum manipulators. Their method is based on using recurrent neural network architecture to predict the motion of manipulators in real time.

In this blog post, I intend to explain the outcomes of their work by going over the   reported results and to clearly identify the importance of the proposed approach for modeling the motion of soft continuum manipulators.

# What is the Soft Continuum Manipulator?
Soft continuum manipulators are composed of soft and elastic materials, enabling high flexibility and deformability in contrast to
