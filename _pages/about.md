Welcome, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physical Intelligence Department at Max Planck
Institute for Intelligent Systems. I am currently working on gait optimization
by using Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for magnetic
soft millirobots.

I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering Department at METU.
My academic research focuses on machine learning methods for robotic applications.
